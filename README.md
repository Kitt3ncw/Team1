# -_Video-Game
what:
The project we are doing is based on a AI-racing car game, we will improve the game by adding coins. For example, if users want to success, they either complete a round or gain 10 coins. Also, to improve the gaming expreience, we add the function that cars can go backwards to prevent from stucking on the borders.

why:
The car-racing project is interesting and well-built. If users can get coins, it will be more interesting. In order to improve the game, we want to do this project.
