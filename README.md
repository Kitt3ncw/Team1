# 🏎️ AI Racing Car Game Enhancement

## 📌 What We're Doing

Our project is based on an AI-powered racing car game. We aim to enhance the gameplay experience by introducing **gold coin collection mechanics** , **the ability for cars to move backward** and **the function that upgrade the vehicle**.

### Key Features:
- 💰 **Coin Collection**: Players can collect coins while racing. A player wins by either:
  - Completing a full lap, **or**
  - Collecting **Target coins**.
- 🔁 **Backward Movement**: To prevent players from getting stuck at borders or tight spots, we added the ability for cars to move in reverse.
- 🚗 **Vehicle upgrade**
  - Use the coin to upgrade the vehicle!

These additions aim to make the game more dynamic, user-friendly, and fun.
