# 🏎️ AI Racing Car Game Enhancement

## 📌 Program Description

Our game's demo is based on an open-source project from GitHub. Starting from the main menu, players can choose between two different modes. During the game, players and AI opponents start on the same track and race against each other. By overtaking the opponents and securing a better rank, players can win the game. We aim to enhance the gameplay experience by introducing **Fuction of driving backwards** , **the ability for the buttons** and **the multiple gameplay**.
