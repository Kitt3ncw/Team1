# 🏎️ AI Racing Car Game Enhancement

## 📌 What We're Doing

Our project is based on an AI-powered racing car game. We aim to enhance the gameplay experience by introducing **gold coin collection mechanics** and **the ability for cars to move backward**.

### Key Features:
- 💰 **Coin Collection**: Players can collect coins while racing. A player wins by either:
  - Completing a full lap, **or**
  - Collecting **10 coins**.
- 🔁 **Backward Movement**: To prevent players from getting stuck at borders or tight spots, we added the ability for cars to move in reverse.

These additions aim to make the game more dynamic, user-friendly, and fun.

## 🎯 Why We're Doing This

The original AI racing car game is well-designed and fun to play. However, we believe the experience can be further improved. By allowing players to **collect coins** and **reverse their car**, we provide:

- More **gameplay flexibility**
- A new layer of **challenge and reward**
- Better **user engagement**

We are excited to experiment with these features and polish the racing experience!
